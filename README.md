# NicheSVM

NicheSVM is a tool for analyzing PICs (Physically Interacting Cells) to detect niche-specific expression.

## Example

1. runNicheSVM_mouseEmbryoE7_5.m - PIC-seq data from mouse Embryo at E7.5
2. runNicheSVM_mouseEmbryoE8_5.m - PIC-seq data from mouse Embryo at E8.5
3. runNicheSVM_mouseEmbryoE9_5.m - PIC-seq data from mouse Embryo at E9.5
4. runNicheSVM_mouseHippo.m - Slide-seq data (Puck_200115_08)
5. runNicheSVM_liverPairedNormalized.m - pcRNA-seq data from mouse liver
