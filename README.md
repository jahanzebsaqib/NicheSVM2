# NicheSVM

NicheSVM is a tool for analyzing PICs (Physically Interacting Cells) to detect niche-specific expression.

## Example

1. runNicheSVM_mouseEmbryo.m - PIC-seq data from mouse Embryo E7.5, E8.5, E9.5
2. runNicheSVM_mouseHippo.m - Slide-seq data (Puck_200115_08)
3. runNicheSVM_liverPaired.m - pcRNA-seq data from mouse liver
